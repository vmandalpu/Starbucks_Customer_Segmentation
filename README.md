# Machine Learning Engineer Nano Degree Starbucks Captstone Project
Capstone Project as part of Udacity MLE Nano Degree Program

Project Overview

The Starbucks Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone challenge data set is a simulation of customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile application. Periodically, Starbucks sends offers to users that may be an advertisement, discount, or buy one get on free (BOGO). An important characteristic regarding this dataset is that not all users receive the same offer.

This data set contains three files. The first file describes the characteristics of each offer, including its duration and the amount a customer needs to spend to complete it (difficulty). The second file contains customer demographic data including their age, gender, income, and when they created an account on the Starbucks rewards mobile application. The third file describes customer purchases and when they received, viewed, and completed an offer. An offer is only successful when a customer both views an offer and meets or exceeds its difficulty within the offer's duration.

Problem Statement

The objective of this capstone project is to discover customer segments that share common traits and find which customer segment is going to respond best to which offer type.  To solve this problem K-Means algorithm is used to find customer segments that respond similary to different kinds of offers.

Nine segments were identified based on silhouette score. Refer to the report for complete details.
